In this lab, we had to set up SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) step by step. 
At first, we set Elasticsearch, Kibana, Suricata and Wazuh.
After a successful installation, we checked the enability status of Elasticssearch and Kibana (The Dashboard).
We, then, successfully login in with correct validation.
